# Healthy Heart Flutter App

## Early Detection of Cardiovascular Diseases Based on Machine Learning.

## Introduction
The heart is human life, and most of the injuries in it are considered dangerous and lead to death, so the world is trying to detect heart diseases early, and artificial intelligence is one of the techniques that contribute to the early detection of heart-related diseases.

## The Problem
Coronary artery sclerosis occurs due to the accumulation of fats inside the arteries responsible for delivering oxidized blood to the heart, and the disease is one of the most fatal diseases from heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

## Future Work
In the future, the work can be improved by enhancing this App for various types of heart disease prediction based on different algorithms and using a larger dataset than the one used in this analysis, which will help to provide better results and assist health professionals in effectively and efficiently predicting heart disease.
